# zemogaUI

A test to prove someone understands full stack web dev.

### Features

Based upon the test, I decided to do this as accesible as possible. [A11y](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility) is often ignored by developers but this specific page is a great example of justice in motion, giving voice to the unheard. 

For this, I used POSH, and proper React with TS, running on Next and deployed with [Now](zeit.co). Primarily, anything clickable is a button, each section contains a title, and all semantic elements have a name. 

The system saves all votes to [airtable](https://airtable.com/), and fetches from there, this gives it little responsiveness but it mught be solved with a cache, a CDN and optimistic rendering.
